# Python Basics II â€“ Functions, Loops, and Conditionals

In this assignment, you'll practice writing Python functions that use loops, conditionals, and string/list manipulation.

## Instructions
- Complete each function in `homework.py`.
- Do not modify the function names or parameters.
- Run the tests using the provided testing setup or your favorite method.

## Exercises

1. `repeat_string(s, n)`  
   Return the string `s` repeated `n` times, separated by spaces.

2. `first_vowel(word)`  
   Return the first vowel in the word, or an empty string if none found.

3. `is_sorted(lst)`  
   Return `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. `remove_duplicates(items)`  
   Return a list with duplicates removed, keeping first occurrences only.

5. `fizzbuzz(n)`  
   Return a list of strings from 1 to `n` using the FizzBuzz rules:
   - 'Fizz' if divisible by 3
   - 'Buzz' if divisible by 5
   - 'FizzBuzz' if divisible by both
   - Else the number itself as a string
